  Why choose custom keyboards over pre-built keyboards?
---

Pre-built keyboards are more cost-effective and function sufficiently for the average user, so why spend more money on a custom built mechanical keyboard? Pre-built keyboards simply meet the bare minimum. For enthusiasts, gamers, and professionals, the keyboard is an essential peripheral-- something they touch and use for hours day in day out. Custom built keyboards allow room for minute customizations that can result in substantial meaningful changes like reduced typing fatigue, quicker workflows with macros, and ergonomic improvements. 

The keyboard is an everyday item like our cell phones, our cars, and our earphones. Our cell phones started off mainly for calls and our earphones were wired. Our cars simply transported us without extra features like built-in navigation systems, seat warmers, and bluetooth connectivity. The improvements introduced to them revolutionized what we thought were merely simple everyday items. What would happen if we put more thought into the keyboard? 

## Summary of Benefits

### Improved Type Feel 

Customize your typing experience. Prebuilt keyboards takes a universal, one size fits all approach that we know often doesn't work for everyone. Some people have a heavy hand and prefer typing with heavier switches while others prefer typing with more sensitive key switches. Some people prefer the tactile feedback over audio feedback. Building your own mechanical keyboard allows you to choose the type of feedback you receive and the intensity of that feedback. 

### Acoustics

The combination of plate, case, switches, keycaps, and mounting style each affect the sound profile of a keyboard. Aluminum cases paired with aluminium plates result in a high-pitched sound profile whereas acrylic cases paired with POM plates result in a deeper sound profile. Acoustics are more relevant when it comes to your enviornment. If you work in an office, maybe you want to build a silent keyboard that won't disturb your colleagues. Or, maybe you're simply an enthusiast who values audio feedback. Custom builds give you full reign over how your keyboard sounds.

### Ergonomics

Custom keyboards allow for numerous layouts. If you are worried about wrist injuries over long time use, you may want to look into ergonomic keyboards. Some common, popular ergonomic keyboard layouts are the Alice keyboards and split keyboards. 

### Programmability 

Most PCB's manufactured for custom keyboards allow for re-programming with the robust QMK software. You can improve your workflow with macros, or ["sequences of events (such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and delays) that can be played back to help with repetitive tasks."](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-do-i-create-macros-bd0f29dc-5b89-3616-c3bf-ddeeb04da2fb#:~:text=Macros%20are%20sequences%20of%20events,key%20or%20a%20mouse%20button.) Some examples of macros are copying and pasting, switching between audio outputs, muting audio sources, or switching between keyboard languages; all of these tasks can be achieved with one single key once programmed as a macro. 

### Aesthetically Pleasing

You can completely customize how your keyboard looks. Customizing your keyboard to your favorite color scheme or a cool looking keyset can bring massive satisfaction because its what you use and see for hours a day.
