Soldering can be intimidating, but it is more simple than it looks. You can do this.

### Prerequisites 

 Always practice safety when soldering. Wear protective eyewear, set up fans, and solder in a well ventilated area. When you are setting up your fans, make sure that you have them intaking the air and directing the flux away from you. 

### Begin Soldering

Prepare to solder. Make sure that your soldering station is set to the correct temperature.
Flip your PCB and plate onto its back side.


Using the soldering iron, touch the tip of the iron to the pin, or ring, on the PCB.

WARNING: Using high temperatures or leaving the iron on the PCB for too long can damage the PCB. 

Come from the opposite direction with the solder. Lightly touch the solder to the pin, making contact for no more than 4 or 5 seconds.

A good soldering joint results in a cone shape with part of the pin visible at the top.

Repeat this process for the remaining switches, making sure to clean the soldering iron tip with a brass sponge between every few switches. Check for straightness of your keys and resolder any switches as necessary. 

TIP: Resoldering is as simple as heating up the joint and using a solder sucker to remove the old solder.
