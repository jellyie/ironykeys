  Reduce stabilizer rattle.

In most prebuilt keyboards, stabilizers are a major contributer to spacebar and modifier keys rattle. To eliminate the noisy rattle of these keys, you can mod the stabilizers by clipping them, lubing them, or performing the band-aid mod. Read below for more details on each modification.

## Clipping the stabilizers

Depending on the type and manufacturer of your stabilizers, you may or may not need to perform this modification. The bottom of your stabilizers may have two prongs that prevent the stabilizer from laying flush on the PCB. To perform this modification, simply take a pair of wire cutters and snip off the prongs. 

## Lubing the stabilizers

You can lubricate the stabilizers to prevent them from rattling. Stabilizers are composted of three main parts: the housing, the stem, and the wire.

Take your brush and spread the lubricant over the inside of the stabilizer housing, covering all sides.

Take a pair of tweezers, or your stem holder tool, and to grab the top end of the stem. Lubricate the two flat sides of the stem.

Place the stem into the housing, with the side with two openings on the stem facing the opening of the housing where the wire will be inserted.

Generously cover the ends of the wire, up to the bend of the wire, with lubricant.

Snap the stabilizer wire into the housing and turn until you hear an audible click.

## Band-aid moddding the stabilizers

You can perform the band-aid mod to further reduce the sound produced from the impact of the stabilizer stems hitting the PCB. To perform this modification, you will need a pair of tweezers, either electrical tape or duct tape or band-aids. 

Cut your material of choice, in this case I used duct tape, into small rectangles that will fit between the holes where your stabilizers will be mounted onto the PCB. 

Place the tape between the two mounting points.

Spread a thin layer of lubricant over the tape. Congrats, you have performed the band-aid mod!
