Before proceeding with the assembly process, ensure that your PCB is working as intended. You do not want to assemble your keyboard only to find out that your PCB is faulty or malfunctioning. 

### Download VIA

There are many software available online for this purpose, but VIA is highly recommended. To download the software, see [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/). 

### Test the PCB
Once you have downloaded the software, plug the PCB into your computer using the appropriate USB connector. VIA should automatically detect your PCB.

Using a tweezer, touch the two metal contacts where the switch will be inserted.

If the key was properly registered, it will light up in VIA. Repeat this step for each key on your PCB.
