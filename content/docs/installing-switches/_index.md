It's time to install the switches! Make sure you have decided whether or not you want to stick with stock switches or to modify them. After soldering them, you will have to desolder and resolder if you decide to make any changes later on If you wish to modifiy your switches, see [Switch Modifications](/docs/modifications/switches/). 

## Begin Installation

Align the mounting plate on top of the PCB and over the stabilizers.

Insert a switch at each corner of the mounting plate and other areas in the center of the plate that need support.

PCB mounted switches can be snapped directly into the PCB. Plate mounted switches will need to be soldered onto the board.

After inserting the remaining switches, turn over your PCB and check that each switch pin is sticking straight up and not bent or damaged. If a pin is bent, you can simply straighten it with a pair of tweezers.
