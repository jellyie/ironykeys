  Enhance your switches.

You can further fine tune your typing experience by modifying your switches to enhance the type feel. Some modifications you can perform are lubing the switch, filming the switch, or swapping the springs. While most stock switches are adequate, lubing the switch is one of the most highly recommended modifications. Read below for more details on each modification.

## Lubing the switch

Lubing the switch housings and stem can reduce the scratchy sound produced from the stem rubbing against the housing. It also results in a smoother key press and different sound signature. To lube a switch, you will need:

- Switch lubricant
- A thin brush
- Switch opener
- 3-4 Bowls
- Lubricant station (optional)
- Switch stem holder (optional)

### Disassemble the switch

Place the switch above the switch opener, lining up the two plastic prongs with the matching prongs on the switch opener.

Push the switch down into the switch opener and the upper switch housing should pop up.

Remove the top housing and take apart the switch.

A mechanical switch is composed of four parts as shown in the image below. From left to right, there is the spring, the stem, the upper housing, and the bottom housing. The bottom housing also holds a metal leaf.

Disassemble all the switches and separate the parts in each of the empty bowls. If you have a lubricant station, mount the bottom housings into the station. 

### Lube and assemble the switch

Take the brush and dab it into the lubricant. A small amount of lubricant should be enough. Use the brush to lightly spread the lubricant inside the bottom housing of the switch.

You can lube the springs one by one, lightly brushing the lubricant over the whole spring. You can also lube the springs all at once by placing an adequate amount of lubricant into a ziploc bag and shaking the bag with the springs inside. Place the spring on top of the bottom housing.

Take the switch stem holder or a tweezer to hold the top end of the stem and brush all four sides of the switch stem.

{{< imgproc switch_holder2 Fit "1024x768" >}} {{< /imgproc >}}

When you have lightly coated the stem with lubricant, place it on top of the spring with the side with the two prongs facing the bottom housing metal leaf. 

{{< imgproc reassemble_switch2 Fit "1024x768" >}} {{< /imgproc >}}

Place the upper housing over the stem and spring, with the smooth side with the manufacturer name facing in the direction of the metal leaf. 

{{< imgproc reassemble_switch4 Fit "1024x768" >}} {{< /imgproc >}}

Align the two prongs on the side of the switch.

{{< imgproc reassemble_switch3 Fit "1024x768" >}} {{< /imgproc >}}

Press the bottom and upper housing together until you hear an audible click.

Repeat for the remaining switches. Congrats, you have lubed your first mechanical switch!


## Filming the switch

Filming a switch simply refers to the process of placing a plastic film between the switch housings. Switch films are a small piece of precision cut plastic placed between the upper switch housing and the bottom switch housing. It helps reduce wobble and secure the housings when a key switch is pressed. Like other modifications, filming the switch can produce a unique sound signature.

 You can perform this modification at any point while lubing your switch, but I recommend doing this after you have placed the spring into the bottom housing, but before mounting the switch stem. 

Take a pair of tweezers and carefully peel off the film from the film slip.

Carefully place the film on top of the bottom housing. You should see that the film is separated into one larger cut out and a smaller, slimmer cutout. The slimmer cutout should be aligned to the side opposite of the metal leaf.

Congrats, you have filmed your first switch!

## Swapping the spring

A spring swap simply refers to the process of replacing the stock spring that comes with the switch with another spring. Spring come in different weights which affect how heavy or light a key press feels.
