### Into The Case

You're almost done with your first build! After soldering the switches to the PCB, let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes before proceeding. 

Take the PCB and gently place it into the case.

Make sure that the PCB and screw holes are aligned properly.

Using the screws included with the case, screw in the PCB to the case. Make sure not to screw it in too tightly as to not damage the stand offs.
