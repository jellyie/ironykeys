Welcome to the IronyKeys custom keyboard build guide! This guide shows you how to get started building your very first custom keyboard and the modifications you can make to improve an existing keyboard.

## What is a Mechanical Keyboard?

Computer keyboards are an essential computer peripheral that most people are familiar with. Most standard keyboards included in laptops or with desktops fall under the membrane keyboard category. Membrane keyboards rely on electrical contact between membrane layers and conductive circuits triggered by upper-level key presses. Unlike membrane keyboards, the typical mechanical keyboard utilizes spring-loaded key switches where each key is individually isolated from other keys when triggered. 

## Why go custom?

Custom built keyboards can help reduce typing fatigue, quicker workflows with macros, and ergonomic improvements. Build your own keyboard to fine tune how your keyboard feels, sounds, and performs.
