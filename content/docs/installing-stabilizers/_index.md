  How to install the stabilizers. 
---

Stabilizers need to be assembled before installation. If you wish to modify the stabilizers before assembly, see [Stabilizer Modifications](/docs/modifications/stabilizers/). 

## Assembling the stabilizers 

Stabilizers are composed of three main compontents: the wire, the housings, and the stems.

Place the stem into the housing, with the side with two openings on the stem facing the opening of the housing where the wire will be inserted.

Snap the stabilizer wire into the housing and turn until you hear an audible click. 

## Installing Stabilizers 

This guide will show you how to install screw-in stabilizers.

The PCB will have cutout holes for the stabilizers. You should see a pair of larger holes and a pair of smaller holes on the PCB as shown below.

One side of the stabilizer housings should have two clips sticking out.

Insert this side into the larger holes on the PCB.

Push the other side of the two housings down firmly.

Flip over your PCB. You should see the clips latched onto the PCB.

Take the screws included in the stabilizer kit and prepare them for the PCB. If there are O-rings included, slip them over the screw. O-rings help cushion the screw onto the PCB to further help with rattling and protect the PCB from the metal.

Firmly screw down the stabilizer housings.

Congrats, you hae installed your first stabilizer! Repeat this process for the remaining stabilizers.
