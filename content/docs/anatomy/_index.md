Mechanical keyboards are composed of six main components: the PCB, the case, the plate, switches, stabilizers, and keycaps. Building a custom keyboard allows you to fine tune your keyboard down to each single component. 

## The Printed Circuit Board aka PCB

The PCB connects all the electronic components of the keyboard. If there are pre-soldered RGB or LED lights, it also powers the lighting configurations. There are two types of PCBs: solderable PCBs and hot-swappable PCBs. Hot-swappable PCBs do not require soldering, while solderable PCBs do.

## Case

The case is the enclosure that holds all the internal parts of the keyboard together. Cases come in varying materials; some common case materials are aluminium, acrylic, and polycarbonate.

## Plate 

A plate is a cutout piece placed between the key switches and the PCB. Like the case, plates are made out of many types of material including brass, aluminum, steel, polycarbonate, and carbon fiber. Plates provide a more stable and consistent typing experience in contrast to plateless builds where the PCB absorbs most of the shock. It also secures the switches and improves typing acoustics. However, plates are optional albeit highly recommended.

## Stabilizers 

Keycaps are measured in units; one single key is considered 1u. Any key measuring 2u or more typically requires a stabilizer to prevent it from wobbling when one side is pressed down. Stabilizers also ensure that longer keys are balanced. The keys that typically require a stabilizer are the spacebar and modifier keys. Stabilizers come in three different formats: plate-mounted, PCB-mounted, and screw-in. Plate-mounted stabilizers are mounted on the plate, PCB-mounted stabilizers are snapped into the PCB itself, and screw-in stabilizers are directly screwed into the PCB.

## Key Switches

Key switches are connected to the PCB and registers when a key has been pressed. They come in many variants with Cherry MX switches leading the mainstream market. Some other popular key switch manufacturers are Kailh, Gateron, Outemu, and JWK. Switches are categorized by three main characteristics-- clicky, tactile, and linear. Clicky switches actuate with an audible click sound. Tactile switches provide a distinct bump, or feedback, indicating that the switch has been pressed. Linear switches are smooth throughout as the key bottoms out. Other factors can influence a key switchâ€™s feel such as the actuation force, the actuation distance, the housing and stem material, and the spring weight. Switches can be mounted via PCB or plate.

## Keycaps 

Keycaps determine the look of a keyboard. Keycaps come in different materials such as ABS, PBT, and POM plastic (Polyoxymethylene/Acetal). Some common legend insertion methods for keycaps include double-shot molding and dye-sublimation. Keycaps come in various profiles such as Cherry, DSA, SA, KAT, and OEM profiles.
