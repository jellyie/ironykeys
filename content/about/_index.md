Irony Keys is a website that provides a basic guide about mechanical keyboards. It's good starting point for newcomers to the custom keyboard hobby. This website originates from an instruction manual and serves as a revision of the original work. If you would like to view the original manual, see the [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qokYrIaeFH8jrCoPEyAPNZhJ0jxr_HSH/view).
